<h1>Qurate Help</h1>
<b>Qurate</b> allows you to view quantitative events in several
different ways, and to judge them as 'good' or 'bad' events (or leave
them marked as 'unknown'). 'Bad'
events can be filtered out of the pepXML file that they came from.<br>

<h2><a name="gui"></a>Graphical Interface<br>
</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
The Properties table shows you information about the quantitative
event -- quantitative ratio, light and heavy areas, etc. Multiple
overlapping events (same peptide, same charge, similar retention time)
may be
rolled into a single event if they have similar ratios. Any overlapping
events
other than the one described in these properties will appear in
'OtherEventScans' and 'OtherEventMZs'.
<h3>Assessment</h3>
Provide your assessment of the current quantitative event here. You can
describe the quantitative event as "Bad" or "Good", or leave it as
unknown.&nbsp; You can do the same with the identification itself --
sometimes it will be clear from the charts that the identification is
probably wrong (e.g., the predicted monoisotopic mass is not the actual
monoisotopic mass).&nbsp; You can also type comments on the current
quantitative event into the text box.&nbsp; Your assessments and
comments will not be saved unless you explicitly save your changes (see
'Actions', below).&nbsp;
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Theoretical Peaks</h3>
This small graph shows the theoretical distribution of light and heavy
peaks for a peptide of
this mass, assuming that the ratio identified for this quantitative
event is correct.<br>
<h3>Event Control Buttons</h3>
The left and right arrows navigate the loaded quantitative events one
by one.&nbsp; The "Show All" button brings up a window with a table
containing all events; you can use this table to navigate to any event.<br>
<h3>Charts</h3>
The charts help you assess the quality of quantitative events.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intensity Sum: </span>A plot of
the intensities summed over all of the scans within the range of the
quantitation event.&nbsp; Blue indicates intensities that are within a
narrow PPM window around each isotopic peak.&nbsp; Green lines indicate
monoisotopic light and heavy peaks, and yellow lines indicate
non-monoisotopic peaks.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Spectrum:</b> A heatmap showing the intensity of the region of
spectra around the quantitative event. Higher intensities are darker
blue. Grey areas on the left and right indicate areas not used by the
quantitative algorithm.&nbsp; Horizontal axis shows increasing
scan number, Vertical axis shows increasing m/z. Red tick marks on the
left and right indicate the light and heavy monoisotopic m/z values.
Red 'X' marks indicate identification events.</li>
  <li><b>Scans:</b> A separate chart for each scan, showing peak
intensities. All intensities are normalized to the highest-intensity
value in any scan (which may or may not be included in the peptide
quantitation). Vertical green and yellow lines indicate monoisotopic
and non-monoisotopic peak m/z values, respectively.&nbsp; Scan numbers
are given at the left -- numbers in green
were used in quantitation, numbers in red were not.</li>
  <li><b>3D:</b> A 3D representation of the same data in the Spectrum
chart. Perspective is that of someone standing at a scan higher than
the last scan shown on the chart, near the m/z of the light
monoisotopic peak. Z axis is intensity. Solid red lines indicate the
light and heavy monoisotopic peaks. Dashed red lines indicate the
beginning and end of algorithm quantitation.&nbsp; Blue 'X' marks
indicate the event used in this
quantitative event. Yellow 'X' marks indicate other identification
events folded into this representation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="selecting_events"></a>Selecting Events for Chart Creation</h2>
There are two ways to select quantitative events for chart creation:
from a PepXML file (peptide level), or from a ProtXML file (protein
level).<br>
<h3>Peptide Level</h3>
To select and build charts for events by peptide identification, you
will need to provide a PepXML file, and mzXML file or directory of
mzXML files, and an output directory.&nbsp; You can do this from the
Tools menu, action "Create Charts...".&nbsp; You may also supply
minimum PeptideProphet probabilities ("minpprophet"), particular
fraction names within the PepXML file ("fractions"), output HTML and
tab-separated-value files ("outhtml" and "outtsv"), particular peptides
to investigate, particular associated proteins to investigate, and
individual scan numbers, as well as a number of advanced arguments,
described within the program, that control the details of how the
charts are made.&nbsp; When all of these parameters are selected, press
"Execute" to immediately build the charts and load them into the
graphical interface.<br>
<h3>Protein Level<br>
</h3>
For selecting events by protein identification, Qurate provides a
detailed interface that allows you to choose only those quantitative
events that you are interested in.&nbsp; Since generating the charts
takes some amount of time, and reviewing them manually takes more time,
you may wish to restrict your chart creation to, e.g., only events with
extreme ratios.&nbsp; This interface provides less control over the
minute details of chart creation, so if you need control over, e.g.,
the mass tolerance around each isotopic peak, you should use the
"Peptide Level" interface described above.<br>
<br>
You will need to provide a PepXML file, a ProtXML file, a directory of
mzXML files, and an output directory for the charts.&nbsp; You can do
this from the Tools menu, action "Protein Summary".&nbsp; You may also
provide a file that maps protein accession numbers to gene symbols
("protgenefile"), an output file for all the quantitative events
("out"), a single protein name to restrict the events to ("protein"),
and a minimum ProteinProphet probability for proteins to consider
("minproteinprohpet").&nbsp; The "appendoutput" argument controls
whether, if an output file is provided that already exists, the new
events will be appended to the existing events in the file or will
overwrite the current file.<br>
<br>
When you have provided all of these arguments, press "Execute".&nbsp;
This will bring up a new window with a table containing one row per
protein.&nbsp; You can save this table to a file for future reference
("Save Table").&nbsp; To view individual events for a protein (or
multiple proteins), select
that protein in the table and press "Show Events".&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The next window shows a table of quantitative events.&nbsp; You may see
multiple quantitative events for the same peptide.&nbsp; Any
events that are already loaded by Qurate will be greyed out. The
quantitative ratio for the event is displayed numerically, and also (in
log scale) as a graphical slider.&nbsp; You can view more information
about each event by pressing "Show Event Properties".&nbsp; When you
select a number of events and press "Build Selected Charts", the charts
will be built; this takes some time, and a status bar will indicate
progress.&nbsp; Any events for the same peptide, within the same charge
state, with the same modifications, with similar ratios, will be
bundled into a single set of charts.<br>
<h2><a name="actions"></a>Actions</h2>
Once you have loaded some quantitative events, you can:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Save Changes:</b> Save your assessments to a file that may be
loaded by Qurate at a later time (under the "File" menu).<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Filter PepXML...:</b>
Under the "Tools" menu.&nbsp; Filter all of your 'Bad' assessments out
of the pepXML file that they
came from. You must specify both the source pepXML file and the output
pepXML file (which may be the same)</li>
</ul>
